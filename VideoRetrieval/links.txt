You'll need to install MongoDB - to do this follow the instructions here
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
After you've installed Mongo, create the data/db folder on the drive you installed Mongo on (alternatively, you can specify another path when starting mongo)
To start Mongo, run X:\path-to-you-installation\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe

That's it - all necessary Java libraries are in the lib folder
